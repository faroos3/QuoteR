QuoteR, a project for Intro to Open Source S'17

# Welcome to QuoteR!

This is the repo for Samad Farooqui, Jarod George, and Stephen Beale's Introduction to Open Source Project for the S'17 term at RPI. 

## The problem and possible use cases 

1) The problem this software is solving is not really a problem, just an enhancement. The software will aim to help people memorize speeches and recognize speeches, because Samad thinks speeches are cool and influential and memorizing with your voice is proven to be one of the best methods of memorization since it utilizes the production effect (http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00886/full). For example, a student who needs to memorize his own variation of the Gettysburg address will be able to type it into the program, save it, and then click a button to record his own voice and then the program will compare how he did against what the speech actually is. This is probably the most useful part of the application. 

2) In the future (possibly picked up by another RCOS group), we would like the application to be able to scan the web for what speech the user is referencing. This could evolve into many other features, such as a game you play with friends to identify which speech one states, for your friends to pick among different speeches.   

Essentially, the problem is trying to help people memorize better. 

## Existing Software

As far as Samad could find, there wasn't too much to help you with this that actually uses your voice. He found this: http://memorizer.me/ but again, that doesn't use your voice. Our project allows you to actually practice speaking and can show you specifically where you went wrong. 

## Technologies we are using 

* Google Speech API: https://cloud.google.com/speech/
* Python 2.7
* TKInter: https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html

## The End Product 
Similar to what's stated above, the end product will be an application that will be able to compare your text input to audio input and display the differences. It will also help people memorize speeches with their voice. The APIs will definitely make life easier, and we're expecting it to be very useful for those who need to memorize stuff for school or a business presentation. Web scraping and the game mentioned above are not goals for this semester, but they are possible for future projects.
